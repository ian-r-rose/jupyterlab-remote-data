This module contain example content manager for the Jupyter notebook server in
order to manage "remote" content. 

Despite it's name "remote" content characterise any content that need to be
accessed via an API and http-range request or similar instead of being delivered
"as a whole".

This can for example include large local file that you wish to consider "remote", 
but could include things like a s3 bucket, or an IPFS filesystem. 

The whole point being that yo uusually don't want to get the full dataset, but
require enough metatata in order to present something to the user.
